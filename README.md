# Dance Party
This is a project I completed while a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). The purpose of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of inheritance patterns in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and to HAVE FUN!

To see the dance party, open dancefloor.html in the browser.
